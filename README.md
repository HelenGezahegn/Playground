# Playground
#### Purpose 
To play around, test, and learn Flutter and Firebase.
#### Approach
Each branch of this repo will represent a different application that was completed either through a tutorial or personal exploration. The branch will contain the detailed commits that led to the completion of the app. Once the app is completed, it will be added to the `master` branch in one push. More details on the applications can be found below.
